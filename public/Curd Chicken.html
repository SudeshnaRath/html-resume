<h1>Emily's Recipe for Dahi Chicken</h1>
<hr />
<p>Dahi Chicken, or Curd chicken, is a rich and flavorful Indian dish where tender chicken is slow-cooked in a creamy yogurt-based gravy, infused with warm spices like cumin, coriander, and garam masala. The tangy curd not only tenderizes the meat but also adds a subtle, refreshing zing that beautifully balances the heat of the spices. Every bite melts in your mouth, delivering a perfect harmony of creamy, spicy, and savory goodnessâ€”making it a comfort food favorite in Indian households.</p>

<h3>Prepping the Chicken</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Wash the chicken properly until the water is clean.</li>
    <li>Soak the chicken in salt water to make the meat tender and soft.</li>
</ul>

<p>After soaking the Chicken in the salt water for around an hour, wash the chicken properly and drain the water. 
    Pat the chicken dry and get rid of all the water. Then you can start marinading the chicken. 
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the chicken is soaking in the salt water, make a paste of Garlic, ginger and Onion, taking a large amount of onion to get rid of the meaty smell. 
    Try to make a smooth paste and don't make it runny.
    </p>
<h3>Marinading the Chicken </h3>
Once the chicken is dried, we can start marinading the chicken. Take the chicken in a bowl and start incorporating the dry  ingredients in the bowl.
<ol>
    <li>Put the onion, garlic and ginger paste to the bowl and massage the chicken in the paste.</li>
    <li>Add the garam masala, Kashmiri red chili powder, Chicken Masala & Peri Peri Powder to the bowl. </li>
    <li>Then add 3 tablespoons of oil to the bowl and massage the chicken and rub all the parts of the chicken with the masalas and oil. </li>
    <li>Then add the Cumin powder, Corriander powder & black pepper.  </li>
    <li>After mixing and rubbing the chicken properly, add 350 gm of curd to the chicken. *drain the curd water*</li>
    <li>Once the curd and all the ingredients are mixed uniformly, rub the Kasuri Methi in your hand to break into finer particles and add to the bowl. </li>
    <li>Put a lid on the bowl and keep it aside for 2 hours </li>
</ol>
<p>Keep the chicken marinade in the room temperature if you're about to cook it in 2/3 hours. 
    Else store it in the fridge, if you'll cook it later. 
</p>

<h3>Cooking the Chicken</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Take a big pot and pour 100 ml of oil in the put and heat. </li>
    <li>Once the oil is heated properly, add the marinaded chicken to the pot.</li>
    <li>Put a lid on the pot and let it cook on medium heat. </li>
    <li>Once you see the meat leaving out water and see the oil settling on the surface, stir the chicken properly and leave the chicken pot, on high heat. </li>
    <li>Soon you'll observe that the water dries out. Taste the curry, if it needs salt then add it. If you want more curry or the curry is very water, add more curd or dahi to the pot. </li>
    <li>Put out the flame when you reach your desired amount of curry. </li>
    <li>Let the chicken rest in the pot for 15 minutes along with the remaining heat, with the lid on. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Garnish with finely chopped coriander leaves.</h3>
<h3>Serve it hot with piping hot Naan, jeera rice, pulao, plain rice or parathas and enjoy!</h3>
