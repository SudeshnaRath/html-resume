<h1>Movies & Show Recommendation by Emily</h1>
<h2>Top 5 Movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Monalisa Smile (Romance/Drama)</h3>
<p>This movie is very intelligent and touching, and I would recommend it to anyone. As you watch these young women develop and grow. A new professor (Julia Roberts) enters a very conservative women's college, focused on traditional ideas. She teaches her art history class to explore more complex questions about art, who also learn to challenge gender norms and expectations. Not only are these young women inspired to lead the life they themselves want to lead (not what other people want), but their teacher learns something about that too; not every woman wants to get an advanced education or have an occupation, because everyone is different and want different things which is perfectly alright. Plus, it includes actresses Julia Roberts, Kirsten Dunst, Julia Stiles, all of which I'm fans of.
    The only thing I didn't love about this movie is how it had some side plots that didn't seem entirely necessary, but honestly I didn't mind at all. It may be poor judgement on my part actually, and perhaps there was a specific reason for certain aspects that I just didn't quite grasp, so I still give this movie 5 stars</p>
<h3>2. My Neighbour Totoro (Anime)</h3>
<p>Miyazaki with yet another masterpiece. This movie is so much more than the story it's the small things that really do it for me. I wouldn’t want to go into any details particularly because I’ve had the privilege of watching this while someone that’s reading this may have not so I’ll just say this it was a wonderful experience. Something about Miyazaki and the way he just gets you to forget about your life for a while and get you to go on this journey with his characters! That feeling is so so rare in today’s world, on a lot of the occasions it feels forced but not with Miyazaki. Hands down one of the best movies I’ve seen in a long long time. It’s quirky, weird but mesmerising and beautiful all at the same.</p>
<h3>3. The Intern (Rom-Com)</h3>
<p>This is hands down the best movie I have ever watched. It just made me feel good the whole time I was watching it, especially because of Ben who was adorable the entire time. He is a very endearing character and I'm positive the actor himself had a huge part in it. Ben was instantly likeable to me because he just had this calm and wise aura about him. Anne Hathaway did a phenomenal job in expressing emotions and made Jules' character seem more fleshed out. Together Jules and Ben were perfect as best friends. It was so natural and little Paige was the cutest pie. The moments she had with Ben made him even more endearing and brought out that fatherly instinct in him.

    Ben and Jules shared some really touching moments and despite Jules' earlier rejection of Ben, she grew to love and trust him and developed a great bond with him. He became her family and that feeling of homeyness was very much present throughout the movie and by that, I mean at Jules' office.

<h3>4. The Kerela Story (Crime/Drama )</h3>
<p>The movie does a good job in raising awareness about such gruesome incidents. It helps us to understand underlying reasons behind such issues and bravely sheds light on ISIS recruitment and how women are used as sex slaves not only from our "God's own country" Kerala but also from other parts of countries.
    The movie exemplifies the methods used by groups to provoke or manipulate in believing or enforcing their way of life on targeted individuals and how foreign groups are involved.
    No doubt it has a lot of potential to influence the audience in a negative way.
    I like the fact that the film didn't glorify the horrors instead it offers a discussion full of facts and critical exploration of the subject.
    Despite being such a serious matter, movie didn't loose it's grip over the intense storytelling.
    Coming to the performances the cast does a commendable job. I can't begin to imagine sturggles of director to bring out such sensitive topic in front of the whole world.</p>
<h3>5. 12th Fail (Drama) </h3>
<p>With love pouring in from audiences and critics alike, and a collection of awards to its name, this movie is undoubtedly turning into a cult classic. Better late than never, I finally watched this highly acclaimed film and have a unanimous opinion about it.  

    The story revolves around a man from a humble background who, despite failing his 12th-grade exams, defies all odds to crack the world’s toughest competitive exam, the UPSC.  
    
    A tale like this resonates with millions, connecting with viewers in one way or another. The fact that it is based on the real-life story of IPS Manoj Kumar Sharma makes it even more grounded and relatable. The screenplay is watertight, leaving no room for dull moments. It takes you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions. The movie’s brilliance lies in its ability to make you root for the protagonist, and by the end, his triumph feels like your own. Above all, it inspires viewers to never give up, no matter how insurmountable the challenges may seem.

<h3>1. Uncontrollably Fond (Romance)</h3>
<p>This is a must watch for anyone, no matter what genre you prefer. I honestly don’t cry much but the last 2 episodes were torture. I became so emotionally attached with hope for a happy ending however this drama amazed me with its realistic ending. The emotional intensity made this drama outstanding and hard to forget. It’s understandable that some might  find it slow at the beginning but the characters become close to you and you keep watching with this hope and where it could lead. The OST was beautiful and well matched to the concept. Hearing it without the drama (even now) brings a little tears!  The acting was down to earth because best acting is only good if it reaches the audience and makes connections to move the heart and this truly touched my feelings. The diversity of expressions played from the actors such as being such a hard character to portraying a soft side. Each and everyone including crew and staff had a wide spectrum of skills when it came to having a variety of ways of helping the characters playing themselves. It could clearly be seen that the cast was made for each other and I’m so glad to have seen the two mains together in this drama. Despite going up and down throughout the drama with hope and having a sad ending there’s still a little light happiness to it too.
    Awesome reaction!</p>
<h3>2. 13 Reasons Why (Tragedy, Teen, Suspense)</h3>
<p>It's a pretty grim premise for a high school drama, even by the standards of death-obsessed YA stories like The Fault in Our Stars and Me and Earl and the Dying Girl. And apart from the occasional friendly banter between Clay and Hannah or the recurring joke about Clay and his fellow students being utterly mystified by the concept of cassette tapes, there's little room for humor here. That can make 13 Reasons Why a pretty emotionally draining experience, particularly towards the end as the pieces really start to fall into place. The final episode in particular features one of the most uncomfortable scenes I've ever watched in a TV drama, period.

    Not really a show that encourages binge-watching, in other words. But 13 Reasons Why definitely succeeds in its goal of exploring how countless small and large acts of malice, as well as simple indifference or inattention, can fuel a terrible tragedy. Hannah herself references Chaos Theory in one episode, and it applies to this situation as well as it does an amusement park full of hungry dinosaurs. Hannah encounters just about every form of humiliation high school life can possibly throw at someone - from social isolation and petty gossip to sexual harassment and worse. The outcome is a foregone conclusion, so it's really more a story about how and why so many of those close to Hannah failed to save her in time.

<h3>3. Taxi Driver (Drama )</h3>
<p>Spectacular .. Literally from the very first episode i was stick to seat.Lee je hoon performance is mind bloooowinnng .His versatility has literally showed up here..He has really took the drama on his shoulders throughout.His cute and funny side in some of the episodes while indulging in the process of revenge made me fall for him truly and on the other hand his stud and stiff side was also really well..This is how a hero is supposed to be fearless and powerful.Some viewers found it odd that how did he managed to fight multiple people at a time but I say why not he is the main lead and main lead is not only supposed to do drama n romance but this is how a main hero is portrayed an also he was an ex army officer so that gave a plus point to his strong physical personality. The drama is so thrilling that you can't expect the next and episode 13 is roller coaster of emotions.All other teammates were unique in their own way..But I didn't liked the role of president jang like literally he did nothing for the safety of his employees. Somewhere i didn't like the role the prosecutor kang because that girl surely has the dedication to stand up against wrong but the directors didn't portrayed her personality really strong .Somewhere this drama is quite senseless also as the hero is fighting and everytime the road is all empty..Their team didn't got arrested because their intentions were good, so what ?wrong is wrong and also I don't think that there was a need to restart the delux taxi at the end the drama could have been ended where everyone begin there life again .But yes as it is a drama you should not search for a logic..You should not think even once before watching.This drama has everything humour,action,thrill, emotions and also no unwanted romanticism.
    Just go for it..</p>
<h3>4. How I met your mother (Sitcom)</h3>
<p>It stands out as one of the greatest sitcoms of all time, seamlessly blending humor with heartfelt storytelling. The series follows Ted Mosby as he recounts to his children the complex journey of how he met their mother, interweaving tales of love, friendship, and the trials of adulthood.

    One of the show’s greatest strengths lies in its unique narrative structure. The use of flashbacks and non-linear storytelling creates a layered experience, engaging viewers with both the immediate comedy and the overarching mystery of the mother’s identity. This narrative technique allows for rich character development, making every member of the core cast—Ted, Robin, Barney, Lily, and Marshall—relatable and memorable.
    
    The humor in How I Met Your Mother is both clever and varied, often employing witty one-liners, running gags, and situational comedy. The character of Barney Stinson is a prime example of this, with his outrageous antics and catchphrases bringing a distinctive flair to the series. Yet, it’s not just about laughs; the show deftly balances comedy with poignant moments that explore themes of love, loss, and the challenges of growing up.
    
    The friendships depicted in the show resonate deeply, illustrating the complexities and joys of close relationships. The chemistry between the cast members enhances the authenticity of their bonds, making viewers root for them through their ups and downs. Episodes like “The Pineapple Incident” and “Slap Bet” showcase the show’s ability to combine humor with heartfelt moments, leaving a lasting impact.

<h3>5. Brooklyn Nine Nine (Sitcom)</h3>
<p>This is my favourite TV show. 
    First of all, comedy’s on point. It can be a little cringey and silly at times but they do it really well! 
    I love ALL of the main characters in this show and I enjoy how all of them are given proper storylines and in-depth backgrounds. I was super excited when season 6 dropped and Hitchcock and Scully were given their very own episode too! 
    The representation in this show is just YES. 
    I love how diverse this cast is, and as a POC, I loved to see it shown on tv. I remember watching this interview with Stephanie Beatriz who said she thought she wouldn’t be casted in the show anymore as they already had a Latina (Melissa Fumero) which just broke my heart. The show wouldn’t be the same without her! I also love how Captain Holt’s sexuality is seen as such a normal thing, and that his whole personality wasn’t just based on him being gay. I liked that they also incorporated Stephanie Beatriz being bisexual as well, making Rosa bi too. Her coming out episode was amazing. 
    This show deals with a lot of issues too: racism, homophobia, sexism, sexual assault, and corruption too. The creators really know how to switch between comedy and seriousness too. 
    
    All in all, if you haven’t seen this show, GO WATCH IT NOW! :)</p>
